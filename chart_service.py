Data source: Polygon.io (consolidated tape across all US exchanges — not just
IEX, which matters for thinly-traded small caps where the IEX-only slice of
volume can badly distort VWAP).

Indicator accuracy notes:
  - VWAP resets at the 9:30 ET session open every trading day (a real
    "anchored" session VWAP), not from an arbitrary point mid-window.
  - EMA9 / EMA20 / MACD are computed over a multi-day lookback so they have
    a proper warm-up period before the display window, instead of being
    seeded artificially at the first bar of the chart.

indicators also now carries (best-effort -- see VOLUME_FLOAT_STATS below):

                                     # days strictly before trade_date
  "relative_volume": 3.84,          # volume_on_entry_day / avg_volume_30d
  "float_shares": 18500000,         # share_class_shares_outstanding from
                                     # Polygon's ticker reference data -- a

Any of the four volume_float fields/tags can be null if Polygon's ticker
reference/daily-aggs calls fail or the plan doesn't include them -- this
never fails the whole /generate-chart call.

This endpoint is never called by the automatic daily pipeline -- it only
exists for the trade site's optional "Support & Resistance (AI)" button, so
reviewing a trade never spends an extra Polygon/LLM call unless you
explicitly ask for one.

Env vars:
  POLYGON_API_KEY          - your Polygon.io API key
  CHART_WINDOW_BEFORE_MIN  - minutes of context before entry (default 90)
  CHART_WINDOW_AFTER_MIN   - minutes of context after exit (default 30)
  CHART_LOOKBACK_DAYS      - calendar days of prior bars fetched purely to
                              warm up EMA/MACD (default 5, not displayed)
  POLYGON_BATCH_SIZE       - Polygon calls allowed per batch before the
                              service pauses (default 5, matching free tier)
  POLYGON_BATCH_WINDOW_S   - seconds to wait between batches (default 65,
                              i.e. Polygon's 60s/5-call window plus buffer)
  POLYGON_BATCH_MIN_GAP_S  - minimum stagger between calls within one batch
                              (default 2.0)
  ENABLE_VOLUME_FLOAT_STATS - "true"/"false" (default "true"). Each chart
                              generation costs 1 extra Polygon call for
                              float (cached indefinitely per symbol) and 1
                              for the 30-day daily-volume window (cached per
                              symbol+date) -- set to "false" to skip both
                              and keep /generate-chart to its original
                              single Polygon call, if you're on the free
                              tier and the extra pacing wait is too slow.
  VOLUME_STATS_LOOKBACK_DAYS - trading days of daily volume averaged for
                              avg_volume_30d / relative_volume (default 30)
